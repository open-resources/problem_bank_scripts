The cannon on a battleship can fire a shell a maximum distance of (32.0,km).

## Part 1 
Calculate the initial velocity of the shell. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
What maximum height does it reach? (At its highest, the shell is above (60%) of the atmosphere—but air resistance is not really negligible as assumed to make this problem easier.) 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
The ocean is not flat, because the Earth is curved. Assume that the radius of the Earth is (6.37times10^3km). How many meters lower will its surface be (32.0km) from the ship along a horizontal line parallel to the surface at the ship? Does your answer imply that error introduced by the assumption of a flat Earth in projectile motion is significant here?
